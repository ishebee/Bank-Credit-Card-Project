# <span style="color:blue;">**Bank Credit Card Analysis**</span>

## <span style="color:green;">**Project Overview**</span>
This project involves analyzing customer data for a bank to gain insights into their demographics and spending habits. The primary goal is to determine the target audience for launching a new credit card. By leveraging A/B testing and statistical analysis, the project evaluates how the new credit card performs across different age groups and identifies the group(s) most suitable for the launch.

## <span style="color:purple;">**Steps Undertaken**</span>

### 1. **<span style="color:teal;">Data Analysis</span>**
   - Explored the customer data to understand spending patterns, demographics, and existing credit card usage.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Conducted descriptive analysis to identify trends and key metrics (e.g., average spending, most common age groups).

### 2. **<span style="color:teal;">Segmentation by Age Groups</span>**
   - Divided customers into age brackets to identify unique spending behaviors and preferences.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess the differences among age groups in terms of:
     - Monthly spending.
     - Types of transactions.
     - Credit utilization.

### 3. **<span style="color:teal;">A/B Testing</span>**
   - Formulated hypotheses to test the performance of the new credit card across age groups:
     - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new credit card does not lead to higher adoption or spending in a specific age group.
     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The new credit card leads to higher adoption or spending in a specific age group.
   - Performed statistical testing using metrics such as:
     - Conversion rates.
     - Average spending.
   - Analyzed Z-scores, critical values, and p-values to draw conclusions.

### 4. **<span style="color:teal;">Recommendations</span>**
   - Identified the age group(s) most responsive to the new credit card offering.
   - Provided actionable recommendations for marketing and rollout strategies.
